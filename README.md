# CGP Grey Inspired Planner (Frontend)

A MERN Fullstack planner drawing inspiration from CGP Grey's organisation system.

## About

In [CGP Grey](https://www.cgpgrey.com/)'s podcast, Hello Internet, on [Episode #39: Getting Things Done](http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/39) (110 mins 54 secs), Grey tells [Brady Haran](http://bradyharan.com/) how he organises his tasks and ideas.

I have taken these ideas and methods and created a MERN Fullstack web app with the aim of making Grey's methods easier to implement and use in your life.

## Installation

1.  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.  Run `npm install` in the project folder
3.  Run `npm start` in the project folder to locally host the website on [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

> This is the frontend and also requires the [backend](https://github.com/tr-jackson/CGP-grey-inspired-planner-backend/) from to function fully
